Description: The DEGGs package enables the exploration of differential gene-gene
    correlations across user-defined groups of samples.
    Provided with normalised counts and a design/metadata matrix,
    DEGGs extracts networks of biological group-specific interactions that can be
    interactively explored through a shiny user-friendly interface.
    For each geneâ€“gene link, differential statistical significance and differential
    regression plots are provided through robust linear regression with interaction term.
